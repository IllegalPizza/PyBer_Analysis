# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to better understand the total weekely fares for each city type that Pyber serves. Using Pandas and Matplotlib we were able to determine this and visualize the data. 


## Results: 

Based on the data we can see that Urban areas have a significantly higher Total Driver Count and Total Rides count, than Suburban or Rural combined. Urban areas also have more Drivers than Rides. This is likely affecting the Average Fare per Driver, which is significantly lower for Urban than Rural and Suburban. Average Fare per Driver for Rural areas is about $20 more than the Average Fare per Ride. Ride Distance may be affecting the Average Fares numbers. As Rural rides may be taken over longer distances and time spans. Urban rides are typically shorter in distance and duration.

The Line Chart furthur shows that urban areas make up the majority of totgals Fares by City type. The chart does not reflect the disparity between Average Fares pre ride and per driver.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Based on our finding I would reccomend decreasing the total number of urban areas drivers by incentivizing them to work in Suburban or Rural areas. This should lower the amount of idle Urban drivers, and increase the Average Fare in Urban Areas. Rural and Suburban areas have more rides than drivers, so an increase in drivers could help with wait times in those areas as well.
